# Palettize

Replace the colors in an image with the nearest colors from a colorscheme.

Try it out [here](https://slarwise.github.io/palettize-serverless).

It is _actually_ serverless, i.e. there is no backend.

## Development

```sh
npx live-server --browser firefox
```

## TODO

- [x] Upload to GitHub Pages
- [x] Add upload image functionality
- [ ] Add download with full resolution functionality
- [ ] Make it look cool, matrix background etc
- [ ] Add more colorschemes
- [ ] Add functionality to use a custom colorscheme
